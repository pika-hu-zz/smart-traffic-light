# Smart Traffic Light

## Introduction

The *Smart Traffic Light* is a rudimentary arduino workshop designed to demonstrate the how technology can make our devices "smarter" in the form of a hands-on exercise. Participants in the workshop will first build a regular traffic light, and then enhance its functionality with additional components modeling IoT sensors.
